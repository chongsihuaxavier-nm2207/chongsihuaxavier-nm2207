                Many couples today face great difficulties in purchasing BTO flats, much less resale flats, with sky high prices. Resale flat prices continue to climb for the 31st straight month, as of February 2023, with a <a href="https://tnp.straitstimes.com/news/singapore/hdb-resale-prices-rise-5-room-pinnacleduxton-flat-sold-134m">5-room Pinnacle@Duxton Flat sold for $1.34 million.</a>
                Elsewhere across the island, flats in towns like Bishan and Redhill continue to be extremely popular, attracting tons of interest from prospective buyers.
